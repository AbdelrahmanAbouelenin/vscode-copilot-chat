# GPT 4.1 Agent Mode Prompt Enhancements

## Overview

This PR enhances the VS Code Copilot Chat agent mode prompts with optimizations specifically for GPT 4.1, incorporating best practices from OpenAI's official GPT 4.1 prompting guide and proven autonomous coding patterns. These changes improve agent autonomy, task completion rates, and overall user experience.

## Key Improvements

### 1. GPT 4.1-Specific Agent Prompt (`GPT41AgentPrompt`)

**New Component**: Created a dedicated prompt component for GPT 4.1 that incorporates advanced autonomous behavior patterns.

**Location**: `src/extension/prompts/node/agent/agentInstructions.tsx`

**Features**:
- **Essential System Reminders**: Implements OpenAI's three critical reminders that increased SWE-bench Verified scores by ~20%
  - Persistence: Multi-message turn awareness with completion requirements
  - Tool-calling: Mandatory tool usage instead of guessing
  - Planning: Required extensive planning and reflection before/after function calls
- **Enhanced 8-Step Workflow**: Based on OpenAI's proven problem-solving methodology
- **Structured Communication Guidelines**: Professional, action-oriented communication patterns
- **Advanced Autonomy Instructions**: Stronger emphasis on independent problem resolution

### 2. Conditional Model Selection Logic

**Location**: `src/extension/prompts/node/agent/agentPrompt.tsx`

**Implementation**:
```tsx
const instructions = this.configurationService.getConfig(ConfigKey.Internal.SweBenchAgentPrompt) ?
    <SweBenchAgentPrompt ... /> :
    this.props.endpoint.family === 'gpt-4.1' ?
        <GPT41AgentPrompt ... /> :
        <DefaultAgentPrompt ... />;
```

**Behavior**: Automatically uses GPT 4.1-optimized prompts when `endpoint.family === 'gpt-4.1'`, maintaining backward compatibility for all other models.

### 3. Enhanced Keep-Going Reminders

**Location**: `src/extension/prompts/node/agent/agentPrompt.tsx`

**Improvements**:
- Stronger persistence language incorporating OpenAI's best practices
- Explicit requirements to perform stated actions rather than just announcing them
- Emphasis on rigorous solution checking and boundary case consideration
- Perfect solution requirements with iteration until completion

### 4. Universal Todo List Support

**Location**: `src/extension/prompts/node/agent/agentInstructions.tsx` (DefaultAgentPrompt)

**Feature**: Moved todo list functionality from GPT 4.1-specific prompt to base prompt, making it available for all models.

**Benefits**:
- Consistent task tracking across all agent mode interactions
- Better progress visibility for users
- Structured approach to multi-step tasks

**Format**:
```markdown
- [ ] Step 1: Description of the first step
- [ ] Step 2: Description of the second step
- [x] Step 3: Completed step (checked off)
```

### 5. Enhanced Tool-Calling Instructions

**Location**: `src/extension/prompts/node/agent/agentInstructions.tsx` (All models)

**Key Additions**:
- **No Guessing Rule**: "If you are not sure about file content or codebase structure, use your tools to gather information: do NOT guess"
- **Planning Requirement**: Mandatory extensive planning before each function call
- **Reflection Requirement**: Required reflection on tool call outcomes

### 6. Continue/Resume Detection

**Location**: `src/extension/prompts/node/agent/agentPrompt.tsx`

**Feature**: GPT 4.1-specific logic to detect "resume", "continue", or "try again" requests and provide appropriate continuation guidance.

## Technical Implementation

### File Changes

1. **`src/extension/prompts/node/agent/agentInstructions.tsx`**
   - Added `GPT41AgentPrompt` class with enhanced autonomous behavior patterns
   - Enhanced `DefaultAgentPrompt` with universal todo list support and improved tool-calling instructions
   - Integrated OpenAI's 8-step problem-solving workflow

2. **`src/extension/prompts/node/agent/agentPrompt.tsx`**
   - Added conditional logic for GPT 4.1 model detection
   - Enhanced `getKeepGoingReminder` function with OpenAI persistence best practices
   - Added continue/resume detection for GPT 4.1

### Model Family Detection

The system automatically detects the model family and applies appropriate optimizations:

- **GPT 4.1**: Uses `GPT41AgentPrompt` with advanced autonomous features
- **All Other Models**: Uses `DefaultAgentPrompt` with enhanced tool-calling and todo list support
- **SweBench Mode**: Uses `SweBenchAgentPrompt` when explicitly configured

## Expected Benefits

### Performance Improvements
- **Higher Success Rates**: Based on OpenAI's research showing ~20% improvement in SWE-bench Verified scores
- **Better Task Completion**: Enhanced persistence and autonomy instructions reduce premature stops
- **Improved Accuracy**: Mandatory tool usage reduces hallucination and guessing

### User Experience Enhancements
- **Better Progress Tracking**: Universal todo list support provides clear task progression
- **More Autonomous Behavior**: Reduced need for user intervention during complex tasks
- **Clearer Communication**: Structured communication guidelines improve user understanding

### Code Quality
- **More Thorough Solutions**: 8-step workflow and final reflection catch more edge cases
- **Better Testing**: Enhanced testing requirements improve solution robustness
- **Systematic Debugging**: Structured debugging approach leads to root cause fixes

## Backward Compatibility

- **Zero Breaking Changes**: All existing functionality preserved
- **Model-Specific Optimizations**: GPT 4.1 improvements only apply when appropriate
- **Gradual Enhancement**: Other models benefit from universal improvements (todo lists, tool-calling)
- **Configuration Respect**: Existing SweBench configuration takes precedence

## Testing Considerations

### Recommended Test Scenarios
1. **GPT 4.1 Agent Tasks**: Verify enhanced autonomous behavior and 8-step workflow
2. **Multi-Model Compatibility**: Ensure all models work with enhanced base prompt
3. **Todo List Functionality**: Test todo list creation and progress tracking across models
4. **Tool-Calling Improvements**: Verify enhanced tool usage and reduced guessing
5. **Continue/Resume Behavior**: Test GPT 4.1-specific continuation logic

### Validation Points
- Agent completes complex tasks without premature stopping
- Todo lists are properly formatted and updated
- Tool calls include proper planning and reflection
- GPT 4.1 follows the 8-step workflow for complex problems
- Other models continue working as expected

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
- **Performance Metrics**: Add telemetry to measure success rate improvements
- **Adaptive Prompting**: Dynamic prompt adjustment based on task complexity
- **Model-Specific Optimizations**: Extend specialized prompts to other model families
- **User Feedback Integration**: Incorporate user feedback to refine autonomous behavior

### Monitoring
- **Success Rate Tracking**: Monitor task completion rates across model types
- **User Satisfaction**: Track user feedback on agent autonomy and effectiveness
- **Tool Usage Patterns**: Analyze tool calling efficiency and accuracy improvements
