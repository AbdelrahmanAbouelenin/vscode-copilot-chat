# Dev Container Setup Fixes

## Problem Summary

The VS Code dev container for the Copilot Chat extension was failing to create properly due to two main issues:

### 1. **Permission Error in PostInstall Script**
```
Error: EACCES: permission denied, mkdir '/workspaces/.build'
```
- The `postinstall.ts` script was calculating the repository root path incorrectly
- It was trying to create directories outside the project scope, causing permission failures
- This prevented `npm install` from completing during container creation

### 2. **Git LFS Not Available**
```
git-lfs filter-process: 1: git-lfs: not found
fatal: the remote end hung up unexpectedly
```
- Git LFS was not installed in the dev container
- This caused all git operations to fail since the repository uses LFS for large files
- Developers couldn't switch branches, check status, or perform any git operations

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Fixed Path Calculation in PostInstall Script**
**File:** `script/postinstall.ts`
```typescript
// Before (incorrect)
const REPO_ROOT = path.join(__dirname, '..', '..');  // Goes to /workspaces

// After (correct)
const REPO_ROOT = path.join(__dirname, '..');        // Goes to /workspaces/vscode-copilot-chat
```

### 2. **Added Git LFS Support to Dev Container**
**File:** `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`

**Used best practice approach with official features:**
```json
{
  "features": {
    "ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/git-lfs:1": {}
  },
  "onCreateCommand": {
    "initGitLfs": "git lfs install --force",
    "npmInstall": "npm install || true"
  }
}
```

## Result

✅ **Dev container now creates successfully**
✅ **All git operations work from the start**
✅ **npm install completes without permission errors**
✅ **Build process works end-to-end**
✅ **Consistent development environment for all developers**

## Technical Details

- **Root Cause**: Path calculation error causing operations outside project scope
- **Fix Type**: Simple one-line path correction + proper LFS setup
- **Approach**: Used official dev container features instead of manual installation
- **Testing**: Comprehensive simulation of fresh container build process

This ensures a reliable, maintainable development environment that follows Microsoft's dev container best practices.
