# Testing ConversationStore Persistence Fix

## Issue Description
The ConversationStore was not persisting conversations across VS Code reloads, causing chat history to be lost when the extension restarted. Specifically, tool-related entries like `create_file`, `<AgentPrompt/>`, and other interactive elements were missing after reload.

## Root Cause
The `ConversationStore` class was using an in-memory `LRUCache` without any persistence mechanism. When VS Code reloaded, all conversations were lost because they existed only in memory. More importantly, the rich metadata containing tool call rounds and tool call results was not being serialized.

## Solution Implemented
1. **Modified ConversationStore** to use VS Code's `globalState` for persistence
2. **Enhanced serialization/deserialization** to preserve `ChatResult` metadata including:
   - `toolCallRounds` - Contains tool call information like `create_file`, `<AgentPrompt/>`
   - `toolCallResults` - Contains tool execution results
   - `codeBlocks` - Code blocks generated during the conversation
   - `renderedUserMessage` and `renderedGlobalContext` - Rich message context
3. **Updated service registration** to use dependency injection instead of direct instantiation
4. **Added size management** to prevent storage bloat (limit to 100 conversations)

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Updated ConversationStore (`src/extension/conversationStore/node/conversationStore.ts`)
- Added dependency injection for `IVSCodeExtensionContext`
- Implemented comprehensive serialization/deserialization for `ChatResult` metadata
- **Critical Fix**: Now serializes `toolCallRounds` which contains the tool interaction data
- **Critical Fix**: Now serializes `toolCallResults` which contains tool execution results
- Added automatic loading on startup and saving on conversation add
- Added size management to prevent storage overflow

### 2. Updated Service Registration (`src/extension/extension/vscode-node/services.ts`)
- Changed from direct instantiation to `SyncDescriptor` for dependency injection

## Technical Details

### What Gets Serialized Now:
- **Tool Call Rounds**: Each round contains:
  - Assistant response text
  - Tool calls made (with name, arguments, and ID)
  - Tool input retry count
  - Round summary
- **Tool Call Results**: Simplified tool execution results
- **Code Blocks**: Generated code with language and resource info
- **Metadata**: Model IDs, session info, command context

### Serialization Strategy:
- **Full preservation** of tool interaction history
- **Simplified tool results** to avoid large object serialization issues
- **Error handling** for individual conversation serialization failures
- **Size limits** to prevent storage overflow

## Testing Steps
1. Start VS Code with the extension
2. Have a chat conversation that uses tools (e.g., `@workspace /new` or ask to create files)
3. Observe that conversation entries appear in chat history, including:
   - `create_file` tool calls
   - `<AgentPrompt/>` elements
   - File creation confirmations
   - Other tool interactions
4. Reload VS Code (Cmd+Shift+P → "Developer: Reload Window")
5. Check that chat history persists and ALL conversation entries are still visible
6. Verify that tool-related entries remain interactive and show proper context

## Expected Behavior After Fix
- ✅ All conversation entries persist across VS Code reloads
- ✅ Tool interaction history (`create_file`, `<AgentPrompt/>`) remains visible
- ✅ Code blocks and generated content persist
- ✅ Chat history maintains full context for multi-turn conversations
- ✅ Tool call results and metadata are preserved
- ✅ No performance impact on extension startup
- ✅ Storage size is managed to prevent bloat

## Before vs After
**Before Fix:**
- Only basic chat messages persisted
- Tool interactions (`create_file`, `<AgentPrompt/>`) disappeared on reload
- Chat history looked incomplete and confusing

**After Fix:**
- Complete conversation history persists
- All tool interactions remain visible and contextual
- Users can see the full flow of their coding session across reloads
